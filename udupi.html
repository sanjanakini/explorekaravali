                    is its worshipping pattern. The prayers and process of the whole worship take place only
                    through a silver-plated window with nine holes called the Navagraha Kitiki. A temple known as
                    Udupi Anantheshwara Temple surrounds the Shree Krishna Matha. This temple traces back to
                    1,000 years.
